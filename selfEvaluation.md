# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel fairly comfortable. As I digest new use cases for them I will become more proficient.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I was already familiar with these concepts, however I did have to get creative to find ways to do some of the exercises like uppercase the first letter of a word in an array. It was fun.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I feel pretty comfortable.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

none
